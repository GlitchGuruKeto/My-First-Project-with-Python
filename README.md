# My First Project with Python

## Overview

This is a simple Python program designed to calculate the net income of a shop based on sales data and user inputs for expenses. The program calculates the total income from different items sold, then asks the user for staff and other expenses to calculate the net income.

## Features

- Displays the earnings from various items sold.
- Calculates the total income from all items.
- Takes user input for staff and other expenses.
- Calculates and displays the net income after expenses.

## How it works

1. The program defines the earnings for different items sold in the shop.
2. It then calculates the total income from all items sold.
3. The program prints out the earned amount for each item, followed by the total income.
4. It prompts the user to enter staff expenses and other expenses.
5. The net income is calculated by subtracting the staff and other expenses from the total income.
6. Finally, it prints the net income.

## Requirements

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `net_income_calculator.py` file.
